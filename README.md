# Analysis of Chemical Components – Cosmetic Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a content-based recommendation system for cosmetic products based on their chemical ingredients. The system helps users, especially those with sensitive skin, to identify compatible cosmetic products using data-driven techniques.

## Organization
MedTourEasy (Traineeship Project – 2024)

## Key Features
- Ingredient-level analysis of 1400+ cosmetic products
- Data preprocessing and tokenization
- Document-Term Matrix generation
- Dimensionality reduction using t-SNE
- Interactive visualizations using Bokeh
- User-friendly exploration of ingredient similarity

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- t-SNE
- Bokeh
- Jupyter Notebook

## Repository Structure
- `Final_Report/` – Project report (PDF)
